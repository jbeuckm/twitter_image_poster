twitter_image_poster
====================

Repeatedly post images to Twitter.

Usage:
======

Create a new app and generate an access token from the [Twitter developer's site](https://dev.twitter.com/). Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and enter your app key and secret. Your app will need to have write access to your account, which requires connecting the developer account to a mobile device, at least temporarily. `app.js` will post the example image to your Twitter user's account.
